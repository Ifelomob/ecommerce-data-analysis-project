## Recommendation and Insights
The most returned product is ELECTRONICS, I think selling better quality Electronic products will reduce the returned rate.
April and August happens to record higher sales among the months of the year while Tuesdays and Thursdays have higher sales records per week. Making sure that there’s more than enough products during this period of high purchase to avoid out of stocks and optimize sales.
Customer’s loyalty programs should be practiced in other to increase sales, retain customers and for customers referrals.
Marketing campaigns aimed at the younger audience should be developed using social media and other digital platforms.
Measures should be put in place to educate the older audience on how to utilize the use of social media and other digital platforms.
